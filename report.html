			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>
				Generally, a Portfolio Website contains a person or company information. It contains about character and skills of a person. Different features are added to show the viewers.	
			</p>

			<h1>Aims</h1>
			<p>
				The ultimate purpose of this website is to provide my skills in professional way for viewers. To reflect my ability in designing certain websites.
			</p>

			<h1>Experience</h1>
			<p>
				In this journey of web designing, I had gained a lot of knowledge about web.
				Since i wasn't able to understand HTML and CSS, but now i am able to understand it.
				However I have to go through sleepless night to learn web designing. I used to visit different cool websites
				and always dream about to make one. I take some advice with my seniors too. I had to visit different tutorials
			    as all they are mentioned in reference.
			</p>

			<h1>Group work</h1>
			<p>
				However, this wasn’t a group assignment. But we have had  a discussion about this assignment with our friends. And try to analyze possible way to do this. After all, we didn’t share our code or way to do this assignment. Instead, we discuss about it.
			</p>

			<h1>Module Expeience</h1>
			<p>
				Web designing is really fun subject for me. Our module teacher is really good
				to explain this subject in intresting way which helps us to understand it easily.However, it was
				really hard for me to understand it in first sight. But after learning certain basics, i think it
				is really great module.
